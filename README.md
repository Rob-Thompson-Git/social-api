## Description

The social-api app is a constructed API utilizing Express.js routing, a MongoDB  database, and Mongoose ORM to handle large amounts of unstructured data (like a social site would!)

There are three main models to store user data, thought data, and a reaction schema. Application users can view different routes in Insomnia, as this is a backend app. The routes include, get all users, get user by Id, update user by Id, create user, and delete user by Id. These same routes apply for the thought data.

## Installation

When users open the application, they can run `npm i` on the root level (server.js level) to install all npm packages. 

## Usage

After installation, users can run `npm run seed` on the server.js file to seed the database. Then, they can run `node server.js` in the terminal to start the server, and application. All routes can be viewed in Insomnia as displayed in the attached demo video.
